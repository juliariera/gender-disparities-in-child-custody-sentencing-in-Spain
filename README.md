## Abstract
In our work, we investigate biases in judicial decisions using data
analytics. Specifically, we are interested in analyzing the impact
of the gender of both the judge and the plaintiff on the probability
of winning a case. With this aim, we analyze a dataset comprising
information from over one thousand second-instance appeals for
child custody in Spain. Our results indicate significant differences in
how legal arguments and facts are utilized in the final sentences, de-
pending on the gender of the plaintiff. We also examine the impact
of the requested type of custody (sole or joint) on the probability
of winning a case, with a focus on its relationship to the plain-
tiff’s gender. Moreover, our analysis reveals statistically significant
differences in the winning probability of a case depending on the
judge’s gender. To further understand these findings, we conduct
additional analysis to establish the causal relationship between the
judge’s gender and the probability of winning, revealing weak but
consistent patterns. Our research provides a consistent methodol-
ogy for evaluating biases in judicial systems and offers intriguing
insights into the context of child custody in Spain.
